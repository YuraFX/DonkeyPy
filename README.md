## Game description

A simple game in which the player drives a car but cannot steer, accelerate or brake, only changing lanes to 
avoid some donkeys on the road. There is no other goal but to avoid the donkeys.

## A little afterword

I decided to set myself a challenge: to write a game in a few evenings, not using third-party libraries like Pygame, 
but using only the standard Python libraries, namely: [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html), 
[Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) and [Winsound](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html). All in all, it turned out very cool :)

# How to play?

[Download](https://github.com/YuraFX/DonkeyPy/releases/tag/1.0) ![windows](images/windows.png)Windows version in release.

Instruction on how to run the game in ![android](images/android.png)Pydroid:

* IMPORTANT! This version of the game should theoretically work on devices with a screen resolution of 480 x 854 pixels. Personally, I tested everything on the BQ-5035 Velvet smartphone (Android 7.0 Nougat).

1. Install [Pydroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&hl=ru)
   
2. Install [Total Commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander&hl=ru)
   
3. Download [DonkeyPy_Pydroid_480x854.zip](https://github.com/YuraFX/DonkeyPy/releases/download/1.0/DonkeyPy_Pydroid_480x854.zip)
   
4. Using Total Commander, unzip the contents of the archive to any convenient place for you
   
5. Go into Pydroid and open the donkey.py file

Enjoying the game :)
