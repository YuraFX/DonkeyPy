## Game description

A simple game in which the player drives a car but cannot steer, accelerate or brake, only changing lanes to 
avoid some donkeys on the road. There is no other goal but to avoid the donkeys.

## A little afterword

I decided to set myself a challenge: to write a game in a few evenings, not using third-party libraries like Pygame, 
but using only the standard Python libraries, namely: Tkinter, Time, Random and Winsound. All in all, it turned out very cool :)
